# Why should we use functions at all?
# - Functions help programme run quicker and get developer purpose faster.
# 
# 
# How to define/declare a function?
# - Build a function.py wwith DEF
# - Import this function and use
# 
# 
# How to call/use a function?
# - Import builded function and call
# 
# 
# What is return, why and how do we use it?
# All the functions return values.So if the programmer doesn’t arrange to return a value, Python will automatically return the value None. The return statement is followed an expression (a in this case). This expression will be
# evaluated and returned to the caller as the “fruit” of calling this function
# 
# 
# Do we have to use return in every function?
# NO
# 
# 
# What are function arguments/parameters, why and how we use it?
# Parameters go with definitions; arguments go with calls. There are
#no return types, parameter types, or reference and value parameters to get in the way, so I am
#now able to teach functions in less than half the time that it previously took me, with better
#comprehension
# 
# 
# How to use function from a different file other than our currently working file?
#Must import this function before using it
